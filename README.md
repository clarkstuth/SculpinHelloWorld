SculpinHelloWorld
=================

Just a test project for Sculpin.  Setting up the HelloWorld demo, maybe a few other things I want to spike out.


Running the site:

	To run the site in dev mode use the following command from the root directory.  Note this expects Sculpin to be already installed globally.

	sculpin generate --watch --server
